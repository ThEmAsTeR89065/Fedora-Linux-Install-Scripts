**Make sure to run these commands with sudo as well as in the current directory** -- I was not able to figure out how to get it working outside of this directory. I'll fix this if I find a solution.
**Remember to chmod +x the files in order to execute them.**

Run full.sh for a full installation with everything included. Otherwise, run desired scripts for whatever you need.

Installation Includes:
1. Optimizing DNF to make it faster
2. Updating the system 
3. Adding the RPM Fusion repos, Flatpaks, and media codecs
4. Installs my favorite theme and icon pack

This Will Install Everything I Need For A Fedora Linux Install Except:
1. Wallpapers - I do not know what type of wallpaper I will want in the future, and matching themed wallpapers is not a priority on distros without a WM.
2. GNOME Shell Extensions - I am honestly too lazy to write a script for this because I don't think I'll use Fedora again. If I'm not using Fedora, I am using something with a WM instead, so this would be a waste of my time. Maybe I'll update this in the future
3. Packages that I may need. I don't want to install extra "bloat" if I don't know what I'll want in the future.
